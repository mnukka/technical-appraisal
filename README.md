## Assignment

# Basic Stepper Setup (Fundamentals)
1. Goal: Create a basic stepper component with static steps.
   * Tasks:
     * Initialize a new Angular component for the stepper.
     * Implement static steps (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, Step 3) using Angular templates.
2. Goal: Enhance thestepper todynamically create steps based on input data
   * Tasks:
     * Modify the stepper to accept an array of step names as input
     * Use angular template functionality to render steps dynamically
     * Implement basic navigation (next, previous) between steps.
3. Goal: Integrate forms into the stepper and implement validation.
   * Tasks:
     * For each step, include a simple form with validation (e.g, required fields)
     * Prevent navigation to the next step if the current step's form is invalid
4. Goal: Allow customization of step content using Angular's content projection
  * Tasks:
    * Modify the stepper to accept custom content for each step
